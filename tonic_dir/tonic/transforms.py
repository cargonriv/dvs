    """Accumulate events to frames by slicing along constant time (time_window),
    constant number of events (spike_count) or constant number of frames (n_time_bins / n_event_bins).
    You can set one of the first 4 parameters to choose the slicing method. Depending on which method you choose,
    overlap will assume different functionality, whether that might be temporal overlap, number of events
    or fraction of a bin. As a rule of thumb, here are some considerations if you are unsure which slicing
    method to choose:

    * If your recordings are of roughly the same length, a safe option is to set time_window. Bare in mind
      that the number of events can vary greatly from slice to slice, but will give you some consistency when
      training RNNs or other algorithms that have time steps.

    * If your recordings have roughly the same amount of activity / number of events and you are more interested
      in the spatial composition, then setting spike_count will give you frames that are visually more consistent.

    * The previous time_window and spike_count methods will likely result in a different amount of frames for each
      recording. If your training method benefits from consistent number of frames across a dataset (for easier
      batching for example), or you want a parameter that is easier to set than the exact window length or number
      of events per slice, consider fixing the number of frames by setting n_time_bins or n_event_bins. The two
      methods slightly differ with respect to how the slices are distributed across the recording. You can define
      an overlap between 0 and 1 to provide some robustness.

    Parameters:
        sensor_size: a 3-tuple of x,y,p for sensor_size
        time_window (float): time window length for one frame. Use the same time unit as timestamps in the event recordings.
                             Good if you want temporal consistency in your training, bad if you need some visual consistency
                             for every frame if the recording's activity is not consistent.
        spike_count (int): number of events per frame. Good for training CNNs which do not care about temporal consistency.
        n_time_bins (int): fixed number of frames, sliced along time axis. Good for generating a pre-determined number of
                           frames which might help with batching.
        n_event_bins (int): fixed number of frames, sliced along number of events in the recording. Good for generating a
                            pre-determined number of frames which might help with batching.
        overlap (float): overlap between frames defined either in time units, number of events or number of bins between 0 and 1.
        include_incomplete (bool): if True, includes overhang slice when time_window or spike_count is specified.
